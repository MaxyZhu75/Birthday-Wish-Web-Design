# :birthday: Birthday Wish Web Design
This frontend website project was implemented by myself using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Actually, you can refer to this repository for every occasion like birthday, anniversary and so on. Only after a few simple configurations and modifications in source codes, you can send an unique and cool birthday gift to him/her.


Notice that the CSS files in this project have already covered both PC end and mobile end, so people can check out this website using their computers or mobile phones. Furthermore, since browsers with recent version, like Chrome and Safari, have "Data Saver" feature which prevents the browser from preloading and autoplaying the audio/video, the autoplay functionality has been implemented in this project. Please check out the [source code](https://github.com/MaxyZhu75/Birthday-Wish-Web-Design/blob/main/code/index.html) for details.


## Deployment


My project has been deployed on the **EdLab**, which is the UMass Educational Laboratory. The EdLab resources are shared by UMass Amherst students taking Computer Science courses, and are maintained by the Computer Science Computing Facility. Considering that machines are located in the Massachusetts, if your connection is unstable, simply refresh a few times please.
